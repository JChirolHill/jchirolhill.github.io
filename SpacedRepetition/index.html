            <p class="card-text">Each day during the semester, you will look at this schedule and see the current day and all classes listed to be reviewed for that day.  Based on the color of the cell, you review the set of notes from the class that was 1 day ago (blue), 3 days ago (green), or 6 days ago (red).  </p>
            <p class="card-text">See <a href="#examples">Examples</a> for a detailed explanation of how to know what to review on any particular day.

            <p class="card-text">Spaced repetition is based on the principle that you remember content better when you review it.  However, the question becomes, how often should I review the content to maximize how much I remember, but minimize the amount of times I have to review the content?  </p>
            <p class="card-text">This is where spaced repetition comes in.  Each time you review the information, the forgetting curve gets less and less steep, meaning you will remember the information longer.  The idea is to let your brain forget about 80% of the content before reviewing it again, setting these reviewing periods to be 1 day, 3 days, and 6 days after you learned the material.</p>
            <p class="card-text">This website generates your personalized spaced repetition schedule based on the days you have each class so that you can best remember the content and not waste precious time trying to relearn everything during finals or reviewing much more than is necessary.</p>
