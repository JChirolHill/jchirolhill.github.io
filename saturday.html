			<p>You can't try to learn a language without trying to speak.  It just doesn't work.  The point of language is oral communication, so it's about time you start talking!</p>

			<p>This is both the most fun and daunting part of language learning.  The main concern is that you are bothering other people with your poor grammar, accent, or whatever else might be holding you back.  The truth is, people are thrilled to know that someone cares enough about their language to try to learn it, and will definitely not feel bothered at all.  In fact, they will want to help you.  If you ask them any questions, they will usually be more than happy to find you.  Of course, this is not the same for everyone, but definitely the case for most.</p>

			<p>If you're shy about what the person might think of you, you can try speaking to complete strangers if you're stuck together somewhere.  For instance the line to just about anything is great place to spark a conversation.  The person will be so surprised it is hard for them not to give you a positive response at you trying to speak their language.</p>  

			<p>What's also great about speaking to strangers is that you can repeat the same conversations with every stranger.  This can help boost your confidence little by little since you now know you can start a conversation confidently.  All you really need is just a few stock sentences: "Hello, I heard you speaking ______ and I am learning that language.  Have you heard of _______?"</p>

			<p>If you're looking for a more meaningful conversation, I highly recommend the website <a href="italki.html">italki</a>.  Here, you can find language partners, or people who are interested in speaking your native language, and who already speak your own target language.  Through the website, you reach out to people who seem like a good match and then you can exchange your contact information (usually Skype or Whatsapp) so that you can continue the conversation, but this time speaking.</p>

			<div class="subtitle">HelloTalk</div>
			<p>Another great resources is <a href="https://hellotalk.com" target="_blank">HelloTalk</a>, an app that connects you with people interested in your native language who speak your target language.  This app is more focused on texting, and it is designed specifically for learning languages.  Whether you want a quick translation of what your friend wrote or to remember a certain text message for future reference, this app does it all.  You can also talk through this app with voice calls for free, making it a good substitute if Skype isn't working one day (that day will come, I promise).</p>

			<p>If you're afraid of making mistakes, don't be.  I know this is easier said than done, but you will learn the most from the mistakes you make when speaking with other since you will remember them the best.  When you do make a mistake, just laugh it off, and the person you speak with can laugh along with you.  Some mistakes are hilarious.  I think of it as making the other person happy rather than as a flaw in how I speak the language.</p>

			<p>Certain things to focus on when speaking:</p>

			<div class="subtitle">Beginner</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to find partners who have at least an intermediate level in your native language.  Otherwise the conversation will be too difficult and most likely fail.</li>
				<li>Ask your partner to repeat new or difficult phrases or to speak more slowly</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="subtitle">Intermediate +</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Ask your partner to correct you if you make a mistake</li>
				<li>If looking for a challenge, look for partners with a low level in your native language so you are forced to speak your target language to communicate instead of falling back to your own language</li>
			</ul>
