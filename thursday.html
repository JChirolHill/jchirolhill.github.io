			<div class="subtitle">Thursday - Writing</div>

			<p>So far, Tuesday and Wednesday have tested how well you can interpret the language, so now Thursday and Saturday help you produce the language yourself, which many argue is the best way to achieve fluency.</p>

			<p>All you need to write is a small post about whatever you want.  To really stretch your learning, try to incorporate any new words you learned from listening on <a href="tuesday.html">Tuesday</a> and reading on <a href="wednesday.html">Wednesday</a>.  Even better, try to use what you learned in <a href="monday.html">Monday's</a> short lesson.  By actually producing meaning using what you have previously learned, you make these sentences come more naturally, and consequently it becomes easier for you to express yourself in this foreign tongue.</p>

			<p>Once you've written your few sentences, look back down at what you wrote, but this time from the perspective of your past self before you started learning the language.  You now have physical evidence to show you how far you've come.  This along with the satisfaction at being able to express yourself in a foreign language is one of the main reasons why polyglots love learning languages.  And this feeling, you can experience it just at the very beginning of your language-learning journey.</p>

			<p>One problem comes up: if I don't know what I did wrong, why bother even writing if I know I'm making mistakes?  I completely agree with you, this small sampling needs to be read by people who speak the language so that they can give you feedback.  But how do you find them?  If your target language is an uncommon language in your area, the chances of finding someone who speaks it are low.  But even if you know someone, asking them to read something you wrote can be daunting or make you feel like you are bothering them.</p>

			<p>An easy solution is the website <a href="lang-8.html">Lang-8.com</a>, one of my favorite websites.  You can click on the link to see my recommendation on how to most efficiently use this website.</p>

			<p>And as usual, here are some handy things to focus on depending on your level:</p>

			<div class="subtitle">Beginner</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Use simple grammatical skills, focusing on getting a message across in simple terms</li>
				<li>Include vocabulary in your entries that you just learned to see if you can properly use it</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="subtitle">Intermediate +</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to include more complex grammatical structures, don't be afraid to take risks</li>
				<li>Include vocabulary in your entries that you just learned to see if you can properly use it</li>
			</ul>
