			<p>We all know live catches up to nip you in the heels, especially when things are going really well.  This is why this day is dedicated to make up for any day that you missed during the week.  There's nothing wrong with missing a day in your weekly goal.  You need to plan your work, but you also need to work your plan.</p>

			<p>If you were able to complete every day's mini mission (first of all congrats!) you can either slack off today, or choose your favorite day's tasks and complete it to your heart's content.  The most important part to language learning is to do a little bit each day, even if it's speaking to yourself in the shower, going over vocabulary on the way to work, or running fake conversations with yourself as you wait to fall asleep.</p>

			<p>If you want to reach this goal, you will easily find the time.  Even looking in those small snippets of extra time count and will each bring you one step closer to fluency.</p>
