			<p>This is the way you will start off the week.  Using a resource with short lessons, for fifteen minutes learn a grammatical structure, about the culture, expressions, or anything else that you're interested in learning about your target language.  Remember to take notes so that you can use what you learned today later in the week.</p>

			<p>The most important part here is to find either an online resource or a print copy (although most of these resources on the web are free) that provides quality and concise lessons that you can complete in one fifteen minute sitting.  The best resources are often in the form of blogs such as <a href="http://www.learning-hindi.com/" target="_blank">this one</a> for learning Hindi or <a href="http://www.russianforfree.com/lessons-russian-language-contents.php" target="_blank">this one</a>  for learning Russian.  Take a look at these websites even if Hindi and Russian are not your target languages to see what kind of website you should look for.</p>

			<p>Based on your level so far, you might want to look for different focuses in these websites.  Outlined below is one possible way you can focus your time based on your level.</p>

			<div class="subtitle">Beginner</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Common or Useful Phrases to You</li>
				<li>Culture</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="subtitle">Intermediate +</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Grammar</li>
				<li>Idioms</li>
				<li>Culture</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Do not feel restricted by the chronological order of the posts, as sometimes, you do not always need to learn complicated grammar structures to learn another.  Go with what interests you the most.  If a lesson is on naming vegetables, but don't see yourself using these words in the near future, pick another short lesson that is more relevant to you.</p>

			<p>We learn best if we want to learn and if the information is relevant to us.  Take advantage of those two facts to optimize the time you spend learning a language.</p>
