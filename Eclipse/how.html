			<p>A day is a measurement of time consisting of 24 hours or part of a count-down to the next eclipse?</p>

			<p>One of the main characteristics that sets apart successful people is that they find better ways to use the same resources that surround us today.  Is Youtube where you go to procrastinate, or is it where you go to learn the skills to learn a language?</p>

			<p>Just because you took classes to learn a language in high school does not mean that this resource was effectively used.  This explains why so many people who take French or Spanish in high school cannot speak it even after four years.</p>

			<p>The eclipse method builds on the following principles.</p> 

				<ul>
					<li><a href="tips.html">Optimizing one's resources</a></li>
					<li><a href="weeklymethod.html">Optimizing one's time</a></li>
				</ul>

			<p>With this website, you'll find valuable language learning tools scattered across the internet and you'll learn a method to best implement them.</p>
