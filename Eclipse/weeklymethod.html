			<p>Unfortunately, many people have big goals, such as learning a language, but have no plan on how to execute them.  We are super motivated the first day and spend hours on our project, but a few days later, all our motivation disintegrates.</p>

			<p>The main problem is that we don't have any <a href="motivated.html">accountability</a> and don't have a feasible method in mind to accomplish such a large goal.  We will address both those problems.</p>

			<p>Since in our ever busy lives, it is simply too difficult to spend the hours necessary to master a language, each day, many may feel there is no point in even trying.  The best method to solve any problem is little by little, taking it one day at a time.</p>

			<p>Even if it is only fifteen minutes every day.  The same amount of time it takes to grab a coffee or check your social media.  Since this is such a small commitment, it will be easier to follow than the overbearing goal to learn an entire language.  Even if your progress is a bit slower, you will still steadily arrive at your goal.</p>

			<p>In fact the method I recommend is exactly this fifteen minute per day commitment, but they must be a well-used fifteen minutes.  Thus the method outlined below should help you address all aspects of language learning.  Each day builds off the next, by taking what you learned in the past week and frequently applying it so that you have the best grasp of the language possible given the small time commitment.</p>
