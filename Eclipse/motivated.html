			Staying Motivated
		</div>

		<p>Motivation.  That infamous word that everyone yearns to claim for themselves, but for some reason, just can't seem to achieve.  And yet, some people seem to have it.  What's their secret?  What keeps these people working through exhaustion and all the times when you're convinced life is working against your goals?</p>

		<div class="subtitle">Accountability</div>

		<p>The accountability is really simple to fix.  Just tell someone close to you that you are learning a language.</p>

		<p>That's it.</p>

		<p>The seeds have been planted.  Now that you've told someone your goal, you are already must less likely to discard it on a whim.  This method not just helps you on your end, but the person you told will help you achieve your goal by encouraging you when you feel unmotivated.  Let others help you accomplish your goal by letting them hold you accountable to make sure you think twice before abandoning your goal.</p>

		<p>But even if you do have someone to hold you accountable, maybe you feel like this goal is no longer worth the time it takes or that you've lost interest.  What do you do then?</p>

		<div class="subtitle">Write a ''Why Am I Doing This'' Post-It</div>

		<p>When you set a goal for yourself, grab a post-it and write your goal on the front.  On the back, write <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> of all possible ways you could be spending your time, this is the way you choose to invest yourself.  Place this post-it on your wall or somewhere you can easily look at.</p>

		<p>Now, whenever you feel your motivation fading, flip over your post-it and remind yourself of why you're in this jam to begin with.  Giving yourself the ability to step back from your current situation and remember the excitement you felt when you set off to learn a language will help, even if just a little, boost your motivation.</p>
