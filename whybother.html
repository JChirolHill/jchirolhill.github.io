			Why Should I Learn a Language?
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>If you ask any polyglot why they love learning languages, many will tell you that it opens the world up to them.</p>

			<div class=subtitle>The World Opens Up to You</div>

			<img src="images/forestpath.jpg" class="rightimg"/>

			<p>With the world more connected by technology more than ever before, one should feel foolish to be satisfied with only knowing one language.  Adopting such a mindset in this age is naive.  There is so much more to language that dismissing all of it is nearly equivalent to dismissing life's opportunities.</p>

			<p>Even speaking just one other language provides you with opportunities you may have never even dreamed of when restricted by the "one language is enough" mindset.  Opportunities should not be wasted, but instead cherished, and learning another language assures you the ability to seize more of those opportunities when they come.</p>

			<div class=subtitle>You Learn a Different Way of Thinking</div>

			<p>Recent studies in cognitive science have revealed what many have sensed for so long: that speaking different languages affects the way you think.</p>

			<p>Take a simple example.  In English, we refer to time as a lateral process with expressions such as, "the past is <span style="font-style: italic;">behind</span> us" or "look <span style="font-style: italic;">forward</span> to the future."  A language like Chinese, however, uses a vertical system.  To say last month, you instead literally say, "The month above this one" as if time were a calendar.  This is just an example of how language shapes thoughts, and thus the way we understand the world.</p>

			<div class=subtitle>You Make Friends You Wouldn't Have Met Otherwise</div>

			<img src="images/twopeople.jpg" class="leftimg"/>

			<p>Speaking to someone in their mother tongue speaks directly to their heart.  When you speak in other people's native tongue, they are usually impressed you are putting in all the effort to learn a language they hold so dear.  They want you to succeed in learning their language and will even help you if you ask.</p>

			<p>Similarly to the previous point, by interacting with natives, you can start to see the world from their eyes, which gives you a fresh outlook on the world you feel like you knew like the back of your hand.</p>

			<p>You can also form life-long friendships, as you have a common appreciation for the language and often accompanying culture.  In most cases, y case, she merely had to utter a few words of Chinese and natives would be both surprised and immediately warm up to me.  Or, if you mention the latest Bollywood film to Indian friends, the conversation just flows.</p>

			<p>So what do you say?  Is now the time to begin a journey that will open your mind and lead to unexpected opportunities and frienships?  Every day counts, so use this one to <a href="weeklymethod.html">take a step</a> towards fluency in another language.</p>
