			Why Choose the Eclipse Method
		</div>
			<p>At some point our lives, most of us have wanted to learn a language
			but unfortunately, most of us fell victim to these myths:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Only kids can learn languages</li>
				<li>You can't work full time and learn a language</li>
				<li>I've already spent years in high school and in college 
					trying to learn this language, but I'm still not fluent</li> 
				<li>I don't have the "language gene"</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Fortunately,
			none of these myths are accurate.  Learning a language is more a matter 
			of better organizing one's time with the tips I give you on this site and finding the right resources to design a learning style unique 
			to you.  </p>

			<p>This website will guide you to meet these goals and help you achieve
			your language learning dreams.</p>
